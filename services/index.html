					</div>

					<h3>Content Management Systems</h3>

					<p>Ever wish you could edit any of the content on your site without needing help from a web designer? We can set you up with a CMS that lets you do just that, custom-tailored for anything you need to update. We have experience building sites in Drupal, Wordpress, Expression Engine & Magento.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<div class="image">
						<img src="../images/services/rad.jpg" />
					</div>

					<h3>Application Development</h3>

					<p>Need something more heavy-duty than a CMS can handle? No problem. We can build you a custom app that's fast, secure and extensible. We've created everything from billing applications to project management systems using our own in-house rapid application development framework.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<div class="image">
						<img src="../images/services/logo-design.jpg" />
					</div>

					<h3>Logo Design</h3>

					<p>A unique & communicative logo is an enormous asset to any company and its brand. We can create a design for you that evokes the feelings you're trying to elicit out of your customers every time they see it, and make it adaptable to any medium. We can even make business cards if you need them.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<div class="image">
						<img src="../images/services/graphic-design.jpg" />
					</div>

					<h3>Graphic Design</h3>

					<p>Our graphic designs are more than just eye candy. They take advantage of usability principles like contrast and proximity to make your site's message easier to understand and guide your users where you ultimately want them to go - whether it's a contact page or a checkout process.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<div class="image">
						<img src="../images/services/ia.jpg" />
					</div>

					<h3>Information Architecture</h3>

					<p>During IA, we create interactive wireframes to emulate the site's flow. These mock-ups ensure the hierarchy & organization of content makes sense before any coding is done. A strong architecture can make even the most complex sites and web applications feel painless.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<div class="image">
						<img src="../images/services/templating.jpg" />
					</div>

					<h3>Front-End Templating</h3>

					<p>We take special care to make sure our HTML & CSS is written semantically which aids in both accessibility and search engine optimization. Our use of progressive enrichment ensures your more technologically-adept users get an enhanced experience without leaving everyone else behind.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<div class="image">
						<img src="../images/services/browser-compatibility.jpg" />
					</div>

					<h3>Browser Compatibility</h3>

					<p>How compatible is your site with older browsers? One site's analytics may show 3% of users using Internet Explorer 6.0, whereas another might hit 70%. Regardless of the story your analytics tell, we have experience fixing all manner of cross-platform bugs. We can make sure it works in AOL 3.0, if you <em>really</em> want.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<div class="image">
						<img src="../images/services/usability.jpg" />
					</div>

					<h3>Usability Analysis</h3>

					<p>Are usability problems making your website or web application hard to use and driving customers away? Let us perform an analysis for you using up-to-date technologies like heatmaps and flow statistics, as well as our own usability expertise. We can help get you back on track.</p>

			<p><strong>Army of Bees</strong> offers three main services: website design, website re-design, and website maintenance. So </p>

			<hr class="small" />

			<h3>Website Design</h3>

			<p>The website <strong>Army of Bees</strong> builds for you can be anything you want it to be. Whether you're looking for a static "brochure" site or a dynamic online community, we have you covered.</p>

			<p>If you can dream it, we can build it. We have experience with implementing blogs, message boards, shopping carts, RSS feeds, streaming video,  and content management systems. We effectively use a plethora of technologies including XHTML, CSS, Javascript, Flash, PHP, MySQL, and XML in order to achieve whatever needs to be done.</p>

			<p>From conceptualization to implementation, our team of graphic designers and web programmers work with you every step of the way to make your website vision a reality. We work hard to create sites that are both visually appealing and easy to use, striking the difficult balance between design and efficiency.</p><br />

			<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="/contact/">Contact Us &raquo;</a></p>

			<hr class="small" />

			<h3>Website Re-Design</h3>

			<p>The Internet is a constantly changing place. New technologies are birthed and new standards are created every day. In the meantime, old technologies are marked as discarded and deprecated. Basically, no matter how cutting-edge a site may be upon its initial design, it will need to be upgraded in the future.</p>

			<p><strong>Army of Bees</strong> is there to help you with this daunting task. We will work with you to bring your aging website up to speed, whether it involves updating a few individual components or giving the entire thing an overhaul. If you need aid distinguishing between what works and what doesn't, our knowledgeable staff will be happy to help you with a free consultation.</p><br />

			<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="/contact/">Contact Us &raquo;</a></p>

			<hr class="small" />

			<h3>Website Maintenance</h3>

			<p>Fresh websites with plenty of updates are typically the ones that keep loyal visitors coming back. If your website requires routine maintenance or updates, and you don't have an in-house person available to maintain the site, A Small Orange can provide you with a quick and affordable solution. Our staff works very quickly so that the turnaround on your updates is as minimal as possible. Find out about our hourly rates to maintain your website today!</p><br />
